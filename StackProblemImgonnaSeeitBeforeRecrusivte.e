# 🧱 Stack-Based Projects (By Gaith)

A complete collection of coding projects and challenges that can be solved using the **Stack (Last In, First Out)** data structure.  
This list is designed to help you master the stack concept from beginner to advanced level through real-world and algorithmic problems.

---

## ⚙️ 1. Valid Parentheses
Check whether all the parentheses, brackets, and braces in a string are balanced and properly nested.

---

## 📉 2. Min Stack
Design a stack that supports `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin` operations in constant time.

---

## 🧮 3. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
Evaluate an expression written in Reverse Polish Notation using a stack.

---

## 🌡️ 4. Daily Temperatures
Given an array of daily temperatures, return how many days you must wait until a warmer temperature.

---

## 📈 5. Next Greater Element
For each element in an array, find the next greater element on its right side.

---

## 🧱 6. Largest Rectangle in Histogram
Find the largest rectangular area possible in a histogram.

---

## 💥 7. Next Smaller Element
For each element in an array, find the next smaller element to its right.

---

## 🔁 8. Simplify Unix Path
Simplify a Unix-style file path like `/a/./b/../../c/` into `/c`.

---

## 🧩 9. Decode String
Given an encoded string like `"3[a2[c]]"`, decode it into `"accaccacc"`.

---

## 🏗️ 10. Balanced Expression Checker
Check if an expression with parentheses, brackets, and braces is balanced.

---

## 🧠 11. Remove Adjacent Duplicates
Remove adjacent duplicates in a string until none remain.

---

## 🧊 12. Browser Back/Forward Simulation
Simulate browser back and forward navigation using two stacks.

---

## ⚡ 13. Infix to Postfix Conversion
Convert an infix expression like `(A+B)*C` to postfix form `AB+C*`.

---

## 🧮 14. Stock Span Problem
Find for each day how many consecutive previous days had a lower or equal stock price.

---

## 🚀 15. Check Palindrome Using Stack
Check if a string is a palindrome using stack logic.
